# Ryan's Environment

TBD. I'm still working to form this new environemnt that will be built around tmux and nvim.

### Context

I've used my own configs of [bash](https://github.com/acu192/config-bash) & [vim](https://github.com/acu192/config-vim) (rather than IDEs) _very extensively_ for most projects over the past ~10 years. Back then (~10 years ago) I spent a lot of time configuring and getting good at those tools. I paid off, as I've been very efficient with them all these years. They have served me well.

In Oct 2023 I came across [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and I also became enlighted to the power of configuring tmux (vanilla tmux is _okay_, but it turns out you can config tmux to be an absolute _monster_ of a tool). Also, arguably vanilla bash isn't great either (I have some custom config to bash, but it might be worth switching that too).

So, I decided to spend some time devising a new set of tooling to form my environment. This repo is where I'll be doing that. Below are some references I'll be using (also the same references that inspired me to take this time and make these changes).
